Covid App to write out information to a new file and a program to use that data in a menu based system to output information.


Covid19 cases are recorded daily for the 5 highest counties in Ireland. On any given 
day the following information is recorded for each county: Date, County name, 
Number of cases, Number of males, Number of females and Median age.

 I wrote a program that will allow a user to enter the details 
for the 5 highest counties and write them to file.

Then I wrote another program that will allow the user to work with the data from the file on a menu-based system.
